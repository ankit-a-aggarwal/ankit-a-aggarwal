Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a graduate student in **Operations Research and Statistics** at Stony Brook University,New York. My interests lie in **Sequential Decision Making, Deep Generative modelling and Bayesian Statistics.**

As part of my graduate degree,I have worked on projects involving **Convex Optimization,Unsupervised Learning,Deep Learning,Portfolio Simulation,Natural Language Processing and Bayesian Optimization for Risk Measures.**

I'm fascinated by **cryptocurrencies**. I genuinely believe that cryptocurrency enabled trustless storage and compute will fundamentally change the way how business is conducted on the internet. Motivated by the wild volatility in it's price movement, I have also built a technical analysis based cryptocurrency trading system using Python.

I am interested in working on problems where **Data Science and Machine Learning** are core to the business and essential to the bottomline revenue of the company.

I'm looking to **collaborate on building out the cryptocurrency trading system**. Please reach out to me if interested.
